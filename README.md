## Eat-Da-Burger App

In this activity, I've created an application that will create a new burger, or choose a burger already available to devour! 

Available to eat burgers are displayed to the left.  The user can devour the burger, and the burgers that have been eaten will appear to the right.  If you don't like any of the burgers displayed, simply enter the name of the burger of your choice, click SUBMIT, and see your burger appear to the left to devour.
